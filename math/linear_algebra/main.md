In linear algebra, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental concepts that help in understanding the structure of matrices and are widely used in various fields, including cryptography.

1. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors Overview:
For a square matrix 
𝐴
A, an eigenvector is a non-zero vector 
𝑣
v such that:

A.v = λ.v

where lamda is called eigenvalue

Essentially, multiplying the matrix 
𝐴
A by the eigenvector 
𝑣
v results in a scaled version of the eigenvector, with 
𝜆
λ being the scaling factor.


Eigenvector: A vector that remains in the same direction after a matrix transformation.

Eigenvalue: The factor by which the eigenvector is stretched or shrunk during the transformation.
