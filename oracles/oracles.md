### what are oracles and how they are useful?

dapps only work inside the blockchain and they are limited to the features.

but blockchain oracles allow smart contracts to get access to systems  external to the blockchain and connect to the data sources


the main goal is to connect to outside datasource


the onchain is same,but the offchain consists of an oracle node and this node fetches the data from the data sources
